Token Burn and Reward System (WIP)
The GINGERBREAD Token Burn feature is currently a work in progress. This feature will allow users to burn their self-generated GINGERBREAD Tokens and receive a special, larger project token as a reward. This functionality is not yet fully implemented, but here's an outline of how it will work once complete:

Example Burn Function (WIP):
python
Copy code
def burn_token(user_address, token_amount):
    """Burn user-generated GINGERBREAD token and reward with a larger project token."""
    burn_url = f"https://api.solana.com/burn?user={user_address}&amount={token_amount}&api_key={self.solana_api_key}"
    response = requests.post(burn_url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Mint a larger token after burn
        reward_url = f"https://api.solana.com/mint-large?user={user_address}&api_key={self.solana_api_key}"
        reward_response = requests.post(reward_url)
        
        if reward_response.status_code == 200:
            return "Burn successful! You've been rewarded with a special token."
        else:
            return "Burn successful, but reward failed."
    else:
        return "Burn failed. Please try again."
This functionality is under development and will be available in a future update. Stay tuned for updates!
