Token Burn and Reward System (WIP)
The GINGERBREAD Token Burn feature is currently a work in progress. This feature will allow users to burn their self-generated GINGERBREAD Tokens and receive a proportional amount of tokens from the developer wallet housing the main token associated with the GingerbreadAI Project. This functionality is not yet fully implemented, but here's an outline of how it will work once complete:

Example Burn Function (WIP):
python
Copy code
import requests

def burn_token(user_address, token_amount, reward_percentage, user_wallet, developer_wallet, solana_api_key):
    """
    Burn user-generated GINGERBREAD token and reward the user with a percentage
    of the developer's GINGERBREAD token balance.

    Args:
    - user_address (str): User's wallet address.
    - token_amount (int): Number of tokens the user wants to burn.
    - reward_percentage (float): Percentage of the developer's token balance to reward the user.
    - user_wallet (str): The wallet address of the user for burning tokens.
    - developer_wallet (str): The wallet address of the developer (from which the reward is given).
    - solana_api_key (str): Solana API key for interacting with the blockchain.

    Returns:
    - str: Result message indicating success or failure.
    """
    # Step 1: Burn the user's tokens
    burn_url = f"https://api.solana.com/burn?user={user_wallet}&amount={token_amount}&api_key={solana_api_key}"
    burn_response = requests.post(burn_url)

    if burn_response.status_code == 200:
        # Step 2: Query the developer's wallet for their GINGERBREAD token balance
        balance_url = f"https://api.solana.com/balance?user={developer_wallet}&api_key={solana_api_key}"
        balance_response = requests.get(balance_url)

        if balance_response.status_code == 200:
            # Extract the total token balance from the response (assuming it's in a JSON format)
            balance_data = balance_response.json()
            developer_balance = balance_data.get("balance", 0)

            # Calculate the reward based on the percentage of the developer's token balance
            reward_amount = developer_balance * reward_percentage / 100

            # Step 3: Transfer the reward to the user's wallet
            reward_url = f"https://api.solana.com/reward?user={user_address}&amount={reward_amount}&api_key={solana_api_key}"
            reward_response = requests.post(reward_url)

                return f"Burn successful! You've been rewarded with {reward_amount} GINGERBREAD Tokens, which is {reward_percentage}% of the developer's balance."
            else:
                return "Burn successful, but reward distribution failed."
        else:
            return "Failed to retrieve developer's wallet balance. Please try again."
    else:
        return "Burn failed. Please try again."
