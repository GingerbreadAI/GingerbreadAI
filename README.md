## GINGERBREAD AI Discord Agent

The **GINGERBREAD AI** also features a **Discord Agent** that interacts with users within Discord servers. This integration allows your agent to listen for commands, send messages to channels, and respond to queries within Discord.

### Features:
- Responds to commands and messages from Discord users.
- Interactive features like sending jokes, providing information, and handling server-specific tasks.
- Can be invited to any Discord server with the appropriate permissions.
- Works well with both public and private channels.

### How It Works:
1. **Create a Discord Bot**: Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new bot, and copy its token.
2. **Configure Discord Integration**: Add your bot‚Äôs token to the `discord_config.json` file.
3. **Invite Bot to Server**: Use the generated OAuth2 URL to invite your bot to a Discord server.
4. **Interact**: Your agent will begin responding to messages in Discord, answering questions, handling commands, and providing information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

The **GINGERBREAD AI Token** is powered by a set of key components that make it highly customizable and scalable. Here's a breakdown of the architecture:

- **Agent Core**: The backbone of the framework, powered by OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models for natural language processing.
- **Task Engine**: Manages the agent's responses and tasks, allowing it to handle predefined actions like greetings, jokes, and more.
- **Social Media Integrations**: Integrates seamlessly with platforms like **Telegram** and **Discord** for easy user engagement.
- **Configuration Files**: `settings.json`, `telegram_config.json`, and `discord_config.json` control the agent‚Äôs behavior, personality, and platform-specific settings.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the framework by adding more tasks, integrating third-party APIs, and modifying agent behaviors as needed.

## Supported Use Cases

The **GINGERBREAD AI** system can be used to build a wide variety of AI-driven applications, including:

- **Chatbots**: Create intelligent chatbots that interact with users in natural language.
- **Virtual Assistants**: Build personal assistants that can perform tasks, answer questions, and automate actions.
- **Customer Support**: Develop AI agents that assist with customer service, provide information, and resolve common queries.
- **Entertainment**: Create fun and engaging agents that tell jokes, provide trivia, or just have a friendly chat.
- **Productivity Tools**: Agents that help automate workflows, schedule tasks, or provide reminders.
- **Telegram & Discord Bots**: Build bots that integrate with popular messaging platforms to interact with users in real-time.



## Code Overview

This project consists of several key components that work together to provide the **GINGERBREAD AI Token** functionality. Below is a breakdown of the important sections of the code:

### 1. **Smart Contract & Token Interaction**
The core functionality of the **GINGERBREAD AI Token** relies on interacting with the **Solana blockchain**. The smart contract allows users to burn their custom tokens and be rewarded with a percentage of tokens held in the developer's wallet.

- **Burn and Reward Logic**: The `burn_token` function handles the process of burning the user's tokens and rewarding them with a percentage of the developer‚Äôs token balance.
- **Solana API**: We use Solana's API to perform blockchain operations such as token burns and token transfers. The API ensures that token transfers happen securely and efficiently.

### 2. **Burn and Reward Function (`burn_token`)**
The `burn_token` function is responsible for executing the burn and reward process:

- **User Token Burn**: The user specifies how many tokens they want to burn from their wallet. This is done by interacting with the Solana blockchain using the Solana API.
- **Developer Wallet Token Reward**: Once the tokens are burned, the function queries the developer‚Äôs wallet to determine how many reward tokens are available, calculates the reward (based on a specified percentage), and transfers the calculated reward tokens to the user's wallet.

This function allows the user to essentially "trade" their tokens for a percentage of another token (held by the developer) as a reward for their action.

### 3. **Configuration Files**
- **`settings.json`**: The configuration file where the user specifies their Solana API key, the developer‚Äôs wallet address, and the reward token address. This is required to interact with the blockchain.
- **`config.json`**: Contains other settings such as the reward percentage and other optional customizations for your GINGERBREAD AI experience.

### 4. **AI Integration (Optional)**
The AI agent is an optional feature that can interact with users, explain the tokenomics, and guide them through the burning process in a fun, conversational manner. You can customize the behavior of the AI to fit your branding and user engagement strategies.

- **AI Interaction**: The AI agent can be programmed to provide personalized responses and guide users through the token burning process.
- **AI Personality**: Customizable AI personality and tasks (like greeting the user, telling stories, etc.) are defined in the `config.json`.

### 5. **Developer Wallet Interaction**
This part of the code ensures that a percentage of the **developer's** tokens are used as a reward for users burning their own custom tokens. The developer wallet address is securely specified in the `settings.json`, and it is used for reward distribution when users burn their tokens.

### 6. **Utilities**
- **`utils.py`**: This file contains helper functions for loading and saving JSON data, including functions to load user-specific settings and configuration files.
- **`log_interaction`**: A logging function to track important events and interactions, such as successful burns or token transfers, which are useful for debugging and transparency.

### 7. **Token Burn and Reward Example Code**
In the main application logic, you would typically use the `burn_token` function as follows:

```python
response = burn_token(
    user_address="USER_WALLET_ADDRESS",
    token_amount=100,
    reward_percentage=10,
    reward_token_address="GINGERBREAD_TOKEN_ADDRESS",
    developer_wallet="DEVELOPER_WALLET_ADDRESS",
    solana_api_key="YOUR_SOLANA_API_KEY"
)

print(response)
```
This code burns 100 custom tokens from the user's wallet, calculates a 10% reward of the developer's tokens, and sends that reward to the user's wallet.
